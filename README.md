# Automation Sampler

Companion repository for AutoCon1 session *Consumable bits of Automation to get you started and Minimizing the Knobs*.

My goal with the presentation and with this repository is to provide a bit of an "automation sampler", perhaps even a mini starter kit of automation ideas.  

The cycle below is a fairly common one I've encountered across every enterprise I've worked for and every client I've supported.  

I've tried to provide some examples of automation at every stage along with some ideas about user input.
